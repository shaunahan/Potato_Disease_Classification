Dataset credits: https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. 
In this project, I built a CNN deep learning model using potato plant images. The goal of this model is to classify these images as either healthy or early blight or late blight. 

Technology used:
Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset <n>
Backend Server and ML Ops: FastAPI <n>
Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite <n>
