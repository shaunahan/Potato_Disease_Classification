## Dataset credits: https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. 
In this classification model, I used CNN to build a model. Technology stack for this project will be,

Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
Backend Server and ML Ops: tf serving, FastAPI
Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite
Frontend: React JS, React Native
Deployment: GCP (Google cloud platform, GCF (Google cloud functions)
