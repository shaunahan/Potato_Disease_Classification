# Potato Disease Classification Using Convolution Neural Networks

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. 
<br>One of the most important steps in automatic identification of plant diseases is to extract the infected region from the normal portion of the plant. Studying the infected leaves it has been observed that the greenness of the infected portion of the leaves changes significantly with respect to the normal leaves. Vegetation indices (VI) are some metric used for the remote sensing images to measure the greenness. Images of potato leaves of both categories healthy and diseased captured with digital camera and resolution of 256x256 pixels forms the dataset. CNN model is used for identifying the health status of plants.<br>
In this project, I built a CNN deep learning model using potato plant images. The goal of this model is to classify these images as either healthy or early blight or late blight.
